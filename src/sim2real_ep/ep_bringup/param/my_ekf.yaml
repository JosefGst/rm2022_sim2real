# want to use its Z position value, then set the entire vector to false, except for the third entry. The order of the
# values is x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw, vx, vy, vz, vroll, vpitch, vyaw, ax, ay, az. Note that not some message types
# do not provide some of the state variables estimated by the filter. For example, a TwistWithCovarianceStamped message
# has no pose information, so the first six values would be meaningless in that case. Each vector defaults to all false

# [ADVANCED] The process noise covariance matrix can be difficult to tune, and can vary for each application, so it is
# exposed as a configuration parameter. This matrix represents the noise we add to the total error after each
# prediction step. The better the omnidirectional motion model matches your system, the smaller these values can be.
# However, if users find that a given variable is slow to converge, one approach is to increase the
# process_noise_covariance diagonal value for the variable in question, which will cause the filter's predicted error
# to be larger, which will cause the filter to trust the incoming measurement more during correction. The values are
# ordered as x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw, vx, vy, vz, vroll, vpitch, vyaw, ax, ay, az. Defaults to the matrix below if
# unspecified.
